# eiffel-bank-ocr
Small programming Kata using Eiffel to implement the BankOCR problem. 

The bank OCR problem is described in http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR

The problem essentially consists of parsing account numbers from a text file. Account numbers are given as follows:

      _  _     _  _  _  _  _
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _| 

And they must be parsed as numbers, and checked for validity (checksum). More details in the provided link.

This is a simple exercise using Eiffel + Github for distributed development.
